    Computes the QR decomposition of a mxn matrix A. This
    is useful for solving linear systems of equations of the
    form Ax = b.

    QR decomposition is more numerically robust than LU and
    Cholesky for poorly-conditioned matrices. Cholesky suffers
    from a squared condition number as opposed to LU and LU is
    restricted to square matrices A.
